        This is activity 6 from the classwork 2. We are working with basic html.
        Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little control 
        over the way that a page is displayed.It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a 
        means of marking up the structure of a document not as a way of determining its 
        presentation.Formatting text to appear on a Web page is therefore different from formatting
        text to appear in a printed document.
