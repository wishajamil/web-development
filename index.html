            Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little control 
            over the way that a page is displayed.  
        </p>

        <A NAME="section_three"> Section Three</A>
        <P>
            It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a means of marking up the structure 
            of a document not as a way of determining its presentation.
