            Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little control 
            over the way that a page is displayed. It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a 
            means of marking up the structure of a document not as a way of determining its 
            presentation. Formatting text to appear on a Web page is therefore different from formatting
            text to appear in a printed document.
